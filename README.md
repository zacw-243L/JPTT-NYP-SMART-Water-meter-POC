# JPTT-NYP SMART Water meter POC
Firstly this project works with a [Kerlink WirnetTM iFemtoCell-evolution LoRaWANÂ® Indoor Gateway for the Internet of Things](https://wikikerlink.fr/wirnet-productline/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=documentation:commercial_leaflet_ifemtocell-evolution_2.9.pdf) and its associated firmware of [KerOS6](https://keros.docs.kerlink.com/) and [KerOS5](https://wikikerlink.fr/wirnet-productline/doku.php?id=wiki:quickstart:quickstart_ifevo).
<br>
The other device that you will be working with is a [AIS01-LB LoRaWAN AI Image End Node](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/cbhhihqz5pknkdnkqoze7/AKYgsyGJRknqMeUeeOHVLyE?dl=0&e=1&preview=Datasheet_AIS01-xB+%26+AIS01-xS_AI+Image+End+Node.pdf&rlkey=eq9oz658wa7xck0ozov8cai6o&st=bgbipr23). 
<br>
The AIS01-LB has a camera and AI processor in the probe. It can take photos, analyze the photos to get digital reading and send the info to the IoT server via LoRaWAN Network.<br>
The AIS01-LB is pre-trained to support image recognition of water meters, gas meters and power meters. It can be trained to support more image recognition for different applications.<br>
The AIS01-LB can send the digital reading after recognized and it can also send the original photo via LoRaWAN as well.<br>
The AIS01-LB is fully compatible with LoRaWAN v1.0.3 protocol, it can work with standard LoRaWAN gateway.
